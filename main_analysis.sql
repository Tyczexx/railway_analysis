 	- in the afternoon: 6:00 - 7:00 pm (1792 passengers) 
 	
Knowing that, it can help in planning train schedules and reducing overcrowding in the future.

In this query, I compared each of hour's passenger count to the average number. 
That's why I used CROSS JOIN which combines every row from first CTE with the single value as a result from second CTE. 
In order to find the busiest hours during a day, I've applied a condition that a time slot had 1.5 times more passengers than the average - then I marked it as a rush hour.

Standard Advance tickets generate the highest revenue (242,388 Â£) - passengers prefer booking in advance in standard class for lower fares.
Both Off-Peak and Anytime ticket types generate similar revenue in each class, with a preference to Off-Peak tickets - there are usually cheaper than Anytime ones.

- Weather conditions
- Technical issues

Attention - during analysis I noticed that in the column reason_for_delay, there are two values: weather conditions and weather, which would be combined. 
Nevertheless, it doesn't change the result.
