## 🚊 UK Railway Journey Analysis with MySQL 
This project analyzes railway journey data in the UK (Jan - Apr 2024) to uncover popular routes, peak travel hours, revenue trends, and punctuality insights. It's a part of my **Data Analyst portfolio**, focusing on business insights using MySQL.

### 📂 Project Structure
The structure contains:
1) 📊 Dataset
   
The source of the dataset used for my analysis is provided via Tableau Public.

This dataset contains customer-level shopping records, including e.g:
- Departure & arrival stations
- Ticket class & ticket type
- Journey status
- Date of journey 
- Price in GBP.

2) 🛠️ SQL Analysis

Here you can find few .sql files:
- one file with some DDL commands helping me to normalize new created database (`database_preparation.sql`)
- one file with analysis for specific business questions (`main.analysis.sql`).
During analysis, I focused on using advanced statements or funcions like  **Common Table Expression (CTE)** , **Window funcions** or **Aggregations** .

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies used for the project
- **Excel** – used in initial data checks, before creating new schema with tables in SQL.  
- **MySQL** – for querying and analysis
- **DBeaver** – as the SQL client for executing and visualizing queries
- **GitHub** – for version control and publishing


### 📌 Key Objectives
1. Identify the most popular train routes by analyzing departure and arrival station data.
2. Determine rush hours for train journeys based on passenger volume trends.
3. Analyze revenue differences based on ticket type and class.
4. Evaluate punctuality of train services and explore key reasons for delays.


### 📈 Future Improvements
- Automate SQL analysis with stored procedures  
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time journey insights, using Power BI or Tableau
